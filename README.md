## My Process

### Project Goals

- Set a time estimate/budget and try to complete the project within that.
- Continue practicing semantic HTML.
- Continue practicing SCSS concepts.
- Continue practicing the process of setting up for a project more so than executing said project.
- Achieve as close to a perfect replica as reasonably possible (e.g., 100% accurate spacing values are not worth an hour of time).

### Project Time

- Estimate: 3 hours
  - 1.5 hours for setting up the page.
  - 1 hour for figuring out how to set up the background with the SVGs properly.
  - .5 hours to complete documentation and deployment.
- Actual: hours
  - ~1.5 hours to plan and draft structure.
  - ~3.5 hours to figure out background and fine-tune spacing/placement.
  - .5 hours to complete documentation and deployment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Adobe XD

### Major Challenges

- Spacing was a significant annoyance until I started taking screenshots in Firefox and pasting them into my design files for precise comparisons. This workflow change helped immensely and if I didn't try it this time, I probably would have given up trying to make the precise spacing in each project because it was too laborious and frustrating. 

### What I Learned

- My experience in this project helped me to realize that I had been dismissing the value of working in design software on these projects. Comparing the Firefox screenshots with the design jpegs in XD was a gigantic QoL improvement. Using components to estimate and measure features like border-radius and box-shadow were also really helpful and I couldn't imagine having to alt-tab through that.

### Continued Development

- I think with the next simple project, I'll have my standard workflow sufficiently squared away. But I will need that next project to reinforce said workflow.
- So far, I've essentially been creating two static interfaces that update at a breakpoint of 1440px. Now that I'm more experienced with my workflow and design software, a new appropriate challenge might be to start drafting more responsive layouts.
- Time estimation will continue to be a priority.

### Useful Resources

- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - The official BEM documentation.
- [CSS Reset Documentation](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - The base for the CSS reset that I use.
- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - Generally helpful best practices regarding Sass/SCSS and the base folder architecture that I use (the 7-1 pattern)
